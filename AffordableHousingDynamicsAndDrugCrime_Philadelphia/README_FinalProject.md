Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between affordable housing and drug and narcotics-related crime in Philadelphia, aiming to uncover potential associations between the two. From datasets spanning from 2008 to 2018 sourced from the Philadelphia Police Department and the Division of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), we explore how the availability of affordable housing and neighborhood conditions influence drug-related crimes. With nearly half of Philadelphia's households facing housing cost burdens, understanding the impact of affordable housing initiatives on crime rates can be critical. Motivated by recent research highlighting the relationship between homelessness and crime, this study seeks to contribute insights into how affordable housing programs can create safer communities and reduce drug-related crime. By adopting innovative methods, this study aims to provide new perspectives on an old problem, bridging gaps in existing research and informing policy adjustments to enhance communities. Ultimately, this research serves as a driving force for innovation and improvement, establishing the foundation for the development of effective strategies to create safer and more fair communities not only in Philadelphia, but also in other urban areas facing similar challenges.
